# LRAE-VC

## Commands, Instructions, Setup
- To run PNC autoencoder (no classification) `python autoencoder_train.py --model=PNC`
- To run PNC autoencoder (with classification integrated) `python autoencoder_train.py --model=PNC_with_classification`

#### Team: John Li, AJ Grama, Wenjie Guo

### General TODOs

- [ ] Implement the second and dual neural network for PREDICTING missing features in latent encodings
- [ ] Implement and incorporate object classification into the autoencoder NN. How to do this? --> (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1svHaRZ1yiAsARJDC_MInBo5Ln_tRjIg14dhBlCV_UsI/edit?usp=sharing)
- [ ] Experimental setup with random packet drops and deadline misses (much easier said than done)
- [ ] Lots of overall architecture tuning

### Specific TODOs + Issues Log
